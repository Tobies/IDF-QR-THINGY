# IDF-QR-THINGY
A Project made for workflow optimization at IDF 6013 Medical equipment unit.

This project was built in order to save time for the soldiers at my unit.
The executable under "Excel-QR" accept Excels files (those files need to be formatted like "Excel-QR/Example.xl" in order to be parsed) and outputs a QR Code
which the soldiers can scan using their phones, the QR Code should redirect the users to the GitHub Pages site with the data supplied by the Excel file.

The site calculates the best route for the user (sorted by shelf number, meaning the user can walk in one circle instead of wandering back and fourth) and gives them
info about the product they need to supply.
